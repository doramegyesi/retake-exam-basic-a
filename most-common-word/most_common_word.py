# This should be a simple word counter which give us the most common word in a file
# If ran from the command line without arguments it should print out the usage:
# python most_common_word.py [source]
# When no argument is provided print out
# No source provided
# When the argument provided and the source is a file
# count all words in the given file and print the most common
# ("cat", "CAT", "cat," "cat." are different words )
